Since I joined Flipkart, I have been been playing around with a lot of linux, networking, k8s, elb, go etc. Although hugely overwhelming at first sight, the learning is proving to be fun and interesting.

Thought of starting a blog to assimilate some ideas in a fun and interesting way. In this blogpost, I have talked about hands on loadbalancing with haproxy, coupled with go and docker compose.

In the modern world of distributed systems, it would be a sin to expose your applications without critical load balancing. We see what pitfalls your app can land into without loadbalancing, and then go on to setup a docker compose cluster locally to test our app with haproxy armoring it. And of course, memes included!

The blog gained a lot of traction and the in fact, the official **HAProxy Technologies Twitter** channel reposted this!
