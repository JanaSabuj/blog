I developed a full stack app that will track and present the Past, Live and Future contests on the most popular sport programming sites.
> Codeforces
Codechef
Atcoder
TopCoder
HackerEarth
HackerRank
Leetcode
Facebook
Google
CSAcademy


The 3 types of contests are split across 3 different routes. Each of them is colour coded for better user understanding. Each contest has a link with which you can directly visit the specific programming site
