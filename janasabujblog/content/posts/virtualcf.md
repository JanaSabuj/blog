I created a program called **VirtualCF** — A Codeforces parser for a specific contest identified by Id. It can be used for uninterrupted and smooth participation in a virtual contest, upsolving a practice contest or even a live contest.

Read the entire blog [here](https://medium.com/@SabujJanaCodes/is-there-any-python-script-that-can-aid-my-codeforces-virtual-contest-participation-ccdede51524a) on *Medium*.

The relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/JanaSabuj/VirtualCF) on *Github*.  
I created a *Youtube* Video for the code walkthrough [here](https://youtu.be/9UNwuovxQm4).
