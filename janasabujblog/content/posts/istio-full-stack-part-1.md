ðŸ—„ Most workloads today are running on Kubernetes. But is only Kubernetes enough for companies? To solve the problems of Networking, Observability, Security, Traffic Control - the world is moving towards ServiceMesh - with Istio being the open source leading service mesh.

Istio enables organizations to secure, connect, and monitor microservices, so they can modernize their enterprise apps more swiftly and securely.

ðŸŽ¯ In this blog, we setup a full stack app in Istio and deploy Istio objects like Gateway, VirtualService, Istio IngressGateway etc. Further, we simulate live traffic to our app and visualise it via Kiali dashboard.

ðŸŒ‹ In further blogs, we will build upon this example to play around with further Istio features like Security, Observability and Traffic Routing.
