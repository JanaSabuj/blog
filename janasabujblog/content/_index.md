Hello, My name is **Sabuj**. Welcome to my spot in the vast Internet ! 

I work as a Software Engineer in [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/) and love experimenting with technology, especially *cloud native*. I like to share my thoughts and coding experiments through tech [blogs]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "Blogs") on *Medium*. Talk to me up about: *linux, networks, systems, elb, golang, cloud, kuberentes, istio, cilium, docker, c++ etc.* 

I live in India, currently exploring the tech-driven city of *Bengaluru*. I am originally from Kolkata, having studied engineering at *Jadavpur University* and am always up for some coveted *"adda"*. I like travelling and would love to set my footprint on *every* corner of the *World* someday.

Although I am an advocate of Science, Literature always has fascinated me.*"Words are our most inexhaustible source of magic, both capable of remedying injury and inflicting it"*. I love writing literature but they don't see the light of the day yet. Maybe they will, sometime in future. 

Music is my companion, especially while programmming. I believe good music fuels good code.

I like thought-provoking discussions and am the *foolish* kid who wants to brainstorm about changing something for better. In my spare time, I like to study the lives of tech founders, Ceos and programmers. Favourite Movie: *"The Social Network (2010)"*

Previously, I have spent time coding at [these](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabujisme) companies. Check out my writings [here]({{< ref "/posts">}}). 

There is more to me but *Brevity is the soul of wit*.
