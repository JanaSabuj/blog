In this modern age of Internet and instant gratification, we have lost the desire to read. 
But I am old school, I still love the feeling of completing a book end-to-end. 

To be honest, the sheer amount of research and dedication 
required on the author's part to write a book is testimony to the fact that the knowledge gained after reading it will be useful 
at some point in life. Also, a book can be our closest friend.

Suggest me a book [here](mailto:jsabujofficial@gmail.com).
